# Treehouse PHP Techdegree Project 06 - Unit Testing in PHP

Students were given a PHP app and asked to write tests using PHPunit and measure test coverage using Xdebug. 

The composer.json file in this repo will have PHPunit installed.  Xdebug must be installed separately:  https://xdebug.org/docs/install
